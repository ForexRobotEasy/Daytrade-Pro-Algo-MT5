## Product Description

Daytrade Pro Algo MT5 is a powerful trading algorithm designed for day traders in the forex market. It utilizes market conditions and indicators to identify entry and exit points for profitable trades. With its advanced features, this algorithm aims to generate consistent profits while minimizing risk.

### Key Features

- Risk management: The algorithm allows users to set the risk percentage per trade, stop loss percentage, and take profit percentage. This helps in controlling the risk and maximizing profitability.

- Trailing stop: The algorithm includes a trailing stop function that automatically adjusts the stop loss level as the trade moves in favor of the user. This feature helps in securing profits and minimizing losses.

- Breakeven stop: The algorithm also includes a breakeven stop function that moves the stop loss level to the entry point once the trade has reached a certain profit level. This feature helps in protecting profits and reducing risk.

- Optimal trade size calculation: The algorithm calculates the optimal trade size based on the user's risk tolerance. This ensures that each trade is executed with an appropriate position size.

- Real-time market monitoring: The algorithm continuously monitors and analyzes market data to identify potential trading opportunities. This helps in capturing profitable trades in a timely manner.

- Backtesting: The algorithm includes a backtesting function that allows users to test the strategy on historical data. This helps in evaluating the performance of the strategy and making necessary adjustments.

### How it Works

The algorithm follows a systematic approach to trading. It starts by initializing the necessary variables and settings in the `OnInit()` function. The `OnTick()` function is responsible for monitoring the market and executing the trading strategy.

The entry strategy is implemented in the `EntryStrategy()` function. This function analyzes market conditions and indicators to determine whether to enter a trade. If the entry conditions are met, the algorithm calculates the trade size using the `CalculateTradeSize()` function. It then opens a trade with the calculated trade size, stop loss, and take profit levels.

Once a trade is opened, the algorithm applies the trailing stop and breakeven stop functions to manage the trade. The trailing stop function adjusts the stop loss level as the trade moves in favor of the user. The breakeven stop function moves the stop loss level to the entry point once a certain profit level is reached.

The exit strategy is implemented in the `ExitStrategy()` function. This function analyzes market conditions and indicators to determine when to exit a trade. If the exit conditions are met, the algorithm closes the trade.

The algorithm continuously monitors market data using the `MonitorMarketData()` function. This allows it to adapt to changing market conditions and adjust the trading strategy if necessary.

The `Backtest()` function allows users to test the strategy on historical data to evaluate its performance.
